    <h1>Vanlife Mutual Aid Fund</h1>
    <p>Decentralized support for nomads — powered by Bitcoin</p>

      <h2>What Is This?</h2>
      <p>We’re building a mutual aid network for vanlifers: a shared emergency fund to help each other surviv on the road. Small monthly contributions from each member grow over time, and can be used when someone in the group needs support.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example:</strong> 10 members contribute $10/month (about 20,000 sats). That builds a $1,200 yearly fund to help cover breakdowns, urgent travel, or health costs.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Why Bitcoin?</h2>
      <p>Bitcoin is decentralized digital money — no banks, no middlemen, and it can’t be inflated away. It’s ideal for nomads: portable, secure, and accessible anywhere. We store the fund in Bitcoin so it can grow and remain sovereign.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example:</strong> If the Bitcoin price rises, our shared fund grows too — without needing extra contributions. 1,000,000 sats saved at $30k/Bitcoin is $300. If BTC hits $60k, it's $600.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>How Multisig Works</h2>
      <p>The fund is held in a <strong>multisig wallet</strong>: a shared vault that needs multiple people to approve a withdrawal. Think of it like a safe that takes 3 out of 5 keys to open. No one can spend the funds alone — decisions are made together.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example:</strong> 5 trusted members hold keys. Any 3 must agree to release funds. This ensures security without central control.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>How Claims Work</h2>
      <p>If someone needs help, they submit a simple request explaining their situation. The group discusses and, if enough signers approve (e.g. 3 out of 5), the funds are sent. It’s fast, fair, and based on community trust.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example:</strong> Alex’s van breaks down in the desert. He messages the group, shares a repair quote, and 3 signers approve $400 in aid. Funds are released the same day.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Transparency & Accountability</h2>
      <p>Every transaction can be publicly verified on the Bitcoin blockchain — anyone in the group can see when and where funds move. We also keep a simple shared log of all decisions, proposals, and votes. It’s all open and auditable by the community.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example:</strong> View wallet activity at <a href="https://mempool.space/address/bc1q9e9z6y69ps9d5quugrm69yyzrnnvquv2l4y8q4" target="_blank">mempool.space</a> using our example address: <code>bc1q9e9z6y69ps9d5quugrm69yyzrnnvquv2l4y8q4</code>.
        <br>See a log of past votes and approvals in a shared Google Doc or Notion board.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>How Mutual Aid Grows Over Time</h2>
      <p>As members contribute monthly and the Bitcoin price increases, the fund gains value even without more members. This allows the group to support larger or more frequent requests over time.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example:</strong> In Year 1, the group helps one member with $500. By Year 3, the same monthly contributions plus BTC appreciation allow for three separate $500 claims per year without draining the fund.
