      <h2>What is Mutual Aid?</h2>
      <p>
        Mutual aid is people supporting each other directly — no middlemen, no bureaucracy. 
        We pool small resources to meet shared needs quickly and transparently.
        It’s been around for centuries and shows up today as community bail funds, food banks, 
        community fridges, repair circles, and co-ops. Historically, Black mutual aid societies,
        labor union benefit funds, and friendly societies did this long before modern safety nets existed.

        <p style="font-size:0.9rem; color:#555;">A community fridge — a modern example of mutual aid, where neighbors share free food for anyone in need.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Examples:</strong> Community bail funds, food banks & fridges, neighborhood tool/repair circles, co-ops, historical lodge & friendly societies, union emergency funds.

      <h2>Van Breakdown Fund</h2>
      <p>
        A dedicated emergency pot for major repairs — transmissions, engines, tires — to keep members moving. Requests are reviewed by the group; if approved, the funds go out fast so no one is stranded.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example:</strong> A member blows a transmission in a remote area. The group approves $1,000 from the fund and the repair gets handled within days.

  <section id="land-fund">
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Land Fund</h2>
      <p>
        A pooled investment to buy land together — for shared camping, events, food production, and long-term security. Members contribute regularly; the land becomes a shared asset managed by the group under clear rules.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example:</strong> Over five years, contributions and appreciation enable the group to buy a multi-acre property that hosts gatherings, offers seasonal camping, and serves as a safe base.

  <section id="what-is-this">
    <div class="card">
      <h2>What Is This?</h2>
      <p>We’re building a mutual aid network for vanlifers: a shared emergency fund to help each other survive and thrive on the road. Small monthly contributions from each member grow over time, and can be used when someone in the group needs support.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example:</strong> 10 members contribute $10/month (about 20,000 sats). That builds a $1,200 yearly fund to help cover breakdowns, urgent travel, or health costs.

  <section id="why-bitcoin">
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Why Bitcoin?</h2>
      <p>Bitcoin is decentralized digital money — no banks, no middlemen, and it can’t be inflated away. It’s ideal for nomads: portable, secure, and accessible anywhere. We store the fund in Bitcoin so it can grow and remain sovereign.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example:</strong> If the Bitcoin price rises, our shared fund grows too — without needing extra contributions. 1,000,000 sats saved at $30k/Bitcoin is $300. If BTC hits $60k, it's $600.
